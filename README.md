# Dungeons and Dragons 
Just a simple Dungeons and Dragons development exercise to freshen up rusted skills.

## Story behind this project
The main point of this project is to create a functional and usable software based upon this very famous and worldwide adopted game (which to be completely honest, I never played :p ) while refreshing some really basic concepts that because of my daily basis work, it started to be put away (a stituation I am changing this very moment). While the expected result is to generate a basic playable game, I will decouple the whole into smaller parts just for simplicity and delivery purposes.

But fun aside, from the technical point of view, my main goal is to run the solution completely on *C#* but, cross-platform. Meaning in my case, macOS Mojave, Ubuntu 18.04 and Wiwndows 10 as my playground.  


## So, C# on a Mac?
Yes, with Visual Studio for Mac as our IDE, C# programming is possible on macOS (or at least so I was told). While there are many differences from the classic Visual Studio (my personal favorite), Mac edition is as fast, expressive, and capable as its Windows counterpart. Also at work this IDE is becoming kind of hot so again, why not giving it a try?  


## What I would like to achieve
I will be using both OOP concepts and VS benefits indistinctly such as: Classes, variables, methods, namespaces, auto properties, encapsulation, and constructorsâ€”while building a reusable class library. Afterwards, we will import the library into a .NET Core command-line app and then, use of arrays, lists, loops, and random numbers to enhance the application.

Final step is use the same library to build a native macOS desktop app, creating a UI with the Xcode Interface Builder and wiring event handlers from the UI to classes in the library. Each project builds on top of the one before so, I hope the resulting code will somehow turn into a Dungeons and Dragons-style character generator (and a Game if possible, in the end).

So in a nutshell, Learning Objectives are:
* Exploring C# on a Mac
* Creating a reusable code library
* Classes and properties
* Loops, arrays, and lists
* Creating a console app
* Creating a command-line app
* Creating a Mac desktop app
* Creating a UI with view controllers and actions
* Last but not least... persist the game data. 


Hope it works and helps someone along the way.
